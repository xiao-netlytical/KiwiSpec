## During the experiment with ChatGPT, we provided the following prompts to ChatGPT and generated Python code based on each prompt is listed below:

### Example 1:

Prompt:

    # With a json file which defines how an application server is classified based on the tcp 
    # and udp ports received and transmitted. 
    # And an API which can check the received ports and transmitted ports against the classification logic in the file.
    # Using a zeek connection log file in JSON as input, can you write code in Python3 
    # to  collect all the received ports and transmitted port, and map an ip to the classified application servers. 
    # The json file to classify an application server is in the format like this, 
    # [{
    #        "app_name": "app_name",
    #        "app_func": "app_function",
    #        "inbound_protocol": "((UDP_port0 and UDP_port1) or (UDP_port2 and UDP_port3))",
    #        "outbound_protocol": "((UDP_port0 and UDP_port1) or (UDP_port4 and UDP_port5))"
    #  }]
    # as an example.
    # Then write the mapping result to a output file.
    # hint to use to steps to get the final result: 
    # 1. aggregate all the transmitted file and received file for an IP
    # 2. apply the classification to the collected ports for per IP.

Generated Code:

    import json

    # Load the JSON file that classifies an application server based on TCP and UDP ports
    with open('app_servers.json', 'r') as f:
        app_servers = json.load(f)

            outbound_matched = eval(app_server['outbound_protocol'].replace('UDP', 'transmitted_ports').replace('TCP', 'transmitted_ports'))
            if inbound_matched and outbound_matched:
                app_servers_matched.append(app_server)
        
        return app_servers_matched

    # Load the Zeek connection log file in JSON as input
    with open('conn.log.json', 'r') as f:
        conn_data = json.load(f)

    # Map each IP to the classified application servers
    ip_to_app_servers = {}
    for conn in conn_data:

    # Write the mapping result to an output file
    with open('ip_to_app_servers.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(ip_to_app_servers, f)

### Example 2:

Prompt:

    # with the ip to application server mapping generated by last generated code. 
    # Can you write Python3 code with the request for
    # Extrafiltration: based on the zeek log in json format, 
    # can you write Python3 code to get the sending bytes in total 
    # and the sending packets in total between two ip pair, 
    # the result should be sorted and limited to top 10
    # and using the result from the previous code generating ip to server mapping to 
    # update the result with 
    # server information for source ip and destination ip in the final result
    # the output should be in two files for top sending bytes and top sending packet count.

Generated Code:

### Example 3:

Prompt:

    # In Python3, based on zeek log, can you get 
    # total onnection count and total durations between an IP pair for per protocol/port, 
    # and sort the result based the longest total duration and limit the result to 100 to an output file.
    # For per ip source, the application server info should be updated later based on the previous result from the code which
    # generates the ip to application mappings.
    # Keep in mind that order by and limit can be used with the same create.

Generated Code:

    import json

    # Read in the connection log file in JSON format
    with open('conn.log.json', 'r') as f:
        conn_log = json.load(f)

    # Read in the IP to application server mapping file

### Example 4:

Prompt:

    # In Python3, base on the previous result generated by the KiwiSpec for top total duration, 
    # Find the common source IPs which are in both top total duration and top total bytes sender.

Generated Code:

    import json

    # Read in the output files from previous KiwiSpec code
    with open("top_duration.json", "r") as f:
        top_duration = json.load(f)

    with open("top_bytes.json", "r") as f:
        top_bytes = json.load(f)

    # Get a set of source IPs from top_duration
    ip_set = set([x["src_ip"] for x in top_duration])

    # Find common source IPs in both top_duration and top_bytes

    # Print the common source IPs
    print("Common source IPs:")
    for ip in common_ips:
        print(ip["src_ip"])
